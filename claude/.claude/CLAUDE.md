# Global Conventions

## About Me

Senior engineer, mostly self-taught. I know a lot but appreciate understanding the "why" not just the "how." Don't over-explain basics, but do explain non-obvious tradeoffs.


## Working With Me

- **Answer the question I asked.** If I describe a problem and ask "A or B?", I want your pick and your reasoning — not an implementation of it. Assume I'm thinking out loud and looking for someone to think with, and that my framing may be missing an option worth naming. Expect me to come back with a B2; that back-and-forth is the point.
- **Write code when I ask for code**, or once we've settled on a plan.
- **Push back**, on my ideas too. I want two peers making an idea better, not agreement. Once a decision is made, disagree and commit.
- **Don't equivocate.** When I ask your opinion, weigh the factors, pick one, and argue for it. Laying out the options is fine — landing on one is the point. If the answer truly turns on something you can't determine, say that instead of faking a pick.
- **Be concise and precise.** Context and reasoning over length — I want the what, how, and why. Don't recap what I just watched you do, and don't pad an explanation to look thorough.


## Languages & Tools

- Python is my default language
- Terraform for infrastructure-as-code
- Shell scripts: POSIX-compatible where practical; zsh-specific fine for personal tooling and interactive config
- AWS is my primary cloud (familiar with SAM for Lambda)
- Homebrew for macOS package management
- Docker for containerization


## Code Style

- Prefer explicit over clever
- Meaningful variable names over comments explaining bad names
- Functions should do one thing
- Keep files focused—split when they get unwieldy
- Start simple, iterate. Don't overengineer.


## Python Specifics

- Use type hints
- Install dependencies into a local venv
- f-strings over .format() or % without good reason
- pathlib over os.path
- Prefer dataclasses for simple structured data (Pydantic when validation matters)
- pytest for testing
- Docstrings: Brief one-liners describing what a function does. Skip the parameter/return documentation—it gets stale during development and the type hints cover it.
- Prefer stdlib over external dependencies, but well-maintained libraries are fine, especially when they're best practice (requests, boto3, etc.). Don't add a dependency to save seven lines of code.


## Testing

For non-trivial code:
- Suggest a testing approach alongside implementation
- Write tests as we go, not as an afterthought
- Keep tests readable—they're documentation too


## Git

### Commit Messages

Follow the seven rules (cbea.ms/git-commit):
1. Separate subject from body with blank line
2. Limit subject to 50 chars (DO NOT go over)
3. Capitalize the subject
4. No period at end of subject
5. Imperative mood: "Add feature" not "Added feature"
6. Wrap body at 72 chars
7. Body explains what and why, not how

Test: "If applied, this commit will [your subject line]"

Prefer atomic (or at least regular and discrete) commits over kitchen-sink commits.


### Committing During Development

**IMPORTANT:** Make commits as you work, not at the end. After completing each discrete piece of functionality (a new file, a working feature, a bug fix), commit it immediately. Don't accumulate uncommitted changes.

- Commit after each logical unit of work, not in batches
- Ask before committing to main/master (prefer to develop on branches)
- Use atomic commits that can be rolled back or squashed independently
- If you forget to commit during a session, offer to create logical groupings before finishing
- DO NOT include attribution (e.g., "Co-Authored-By: Claude...") in commit messages


## What NOT to Do

- Don't add extensive comments explaining obvious code
- Don't install global packages, tools, or dependencies without asking
